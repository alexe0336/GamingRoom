Creative technology solution wanted me to create a plan for them to create a web version of their game. I outlined the pros and cons as well as possible ways to develop for mobile and other platforms. I made to sure to explain my recommendations for what they should do as well as researched thoroughly what would be the best for their specific requirements. I found using this design template as an easy way to walk the client through the process. When creating a recommendation for a client you have to look at their requirements but if you think there might be other hurdles that haven't mentioned you might want to alert them of these. One of these I noticed was there small amount of images about 200. Leading to more experienced players getting bored or having an advantage over new players. Despite possibly not being better at the game, but rather just knowing what the images already look like. So perhaps having a massive server hosted image library that changes often and is randomized.
